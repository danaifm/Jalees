Jalees is a website created as a project for our Web Application Development (SWE381) course, which aims to help parents and babysitters alike to find temporary, scheduled babysitting job opportunities.

Features include:
- Sign up as a parent or as a babysitter.
- Post a request for a temporary babysitter for your kid(s), and select the start and end date for the job.
- Babysitters can send offers in SR/hour for each request.
- View babysitter's offers, and accept or reject them.
- Leave a review/rating for babysitters you've worked with.
- Email or contact babysitters via whatsapp.
