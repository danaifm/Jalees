Jalees is a website created as a project for our Web Application Development (SWE381) course, which aims to help parents and babysitters alike to find temporary, scheduled babysitting job opportunities. Jalees was built from scratch in 2 months and was made with lots of love! 👶🏽🤍

# Features include:
- Sign up as a parent or as a babysitter. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- Post a request for a temporary babysitter for your kid(s), and select the start and end date for the job. 📨
- Babysitters can send offers in SR/hour for each request. 💲
- View babysitter's offers, and accept or reject them. ✅
- Leave a review/rating for babysitters you've worked with. ⭐️
